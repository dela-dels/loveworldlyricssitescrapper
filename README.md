NB: This is a work in progress.

TODO:

- Remove some <a data-id></a> tags that seem to appear in some of the extracted lyrics

- The posts are paginated, hence, we have to find a way to get the total number of pages, use that to build a url and visit/loop all pages to extract the lyrics.
  NB: This process may be CPU intensive so we would probably need to find a more efficient way to do it.
